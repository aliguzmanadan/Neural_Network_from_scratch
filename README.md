# Neural_Network_from_scratch
Implementation of a neural network from scratch. Testing implementation in MINST dataset.

In this notebook we implement a Neural Network (NN) form sratch and test this implementation by training it with the MINST dataset.

This is a simple NN implementation whose aim is to explain in a simple manner how the internal details of NN's work. Therefore some issues such as vanishing gradient are not treated here. The same applies for some features like batch normallization, dropput, gradient descent with momentum, etc.

Althoug this is a very rudimentary implementation. It performs very good in the MINST sataset achiving over 96% accuracy on newly seen samples after 3000 iterations of training.
